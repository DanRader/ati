Earrings Galore, is an annual juried exhibition, exemplifying a rich and diverse array of earrings made by emerging and established studio jewelers. Each artist’s unique approach to the earring format will be represented in a cohesive grouping of earrings. The exhibition is intended to create more access for the public to see art jewelry, cultivate connections with the community and provide an opportunity for visitors to add new pieces to their jewelry collections. 
On view at Heidi Lowe Gallery through the Winter Season.
