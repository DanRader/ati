Heidi Lowe Gallery is participating in NYCJW (New York City Jewelry Week) by doing a Pop Up Earring Galore Exhibition in a gallery space on 251 Elizabeth Street from November 14-18th. Earrings Galore, is an annual juried exhibition, exemplifying a rich and diverse array of earrings made by emerging and established studio jewelers. Each artist’s unique approach to the earring format will be represented in a cohesive grouping of earrings. The exhibition is intended to create more access for the public to see art jewelry, cultivate connections with the community and provide an opportunity for visitors to add new pieces to their jewelry collections. Rachel Rader of ATI will have a featured series of earrings from the Asteroid Collection in this travelling exhibition.
