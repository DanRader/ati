Metalwerx and Monique Rancourt Artisan Gallery have collaborated to present a summer exhibition entitled Outside the Lines. The show explores the use of color jewelry in both traditional and unconventional methods from different applications including powder coating, enameling, stone setting, patinas and more.

Rachel will have a collection of designs in the show!
