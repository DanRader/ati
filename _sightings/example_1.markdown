While in residence at MAD, Rader will create objects associated with ATI’s archeological discoveries, including chakra healing tools. Visitors will have the opportunity to participate in interviews for ATI with selected performances of the artist as Ráchel Räder, Chief Investigator, scheduled throughout the spring.
