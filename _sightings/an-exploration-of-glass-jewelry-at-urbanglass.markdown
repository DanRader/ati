This workshop is an in-depth introduction to glass jewelry made in the kiln and cold shop. Learn to create wearable glass forms featuring the brilliant patterns and colors conjured by fusing glass and then carving unique jewels from your kilnformed experiments. In this class, Rachel will cover a survey of jewelry design in combination with metal findings to create heirloom quality jewelry. No pre-requisite in glass or metal required, just a love for jewelry and a desire to learn.
