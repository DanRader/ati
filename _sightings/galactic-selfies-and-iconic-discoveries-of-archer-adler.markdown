A solo exhibition of new work by The Chief, (Rachel Rader). In this exhibition objects serve as relics of Archer’s explorations of time: iconic discoveries uncovered of the “big bang” found in core samples, primordial ooze sourced from the dawn of micro-organisms, and galactic selfies of Archer traveling through time and space.
