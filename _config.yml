description: The Ancient Truth Investigators (ATI) is a project of Brooklyn-based
  artist, Rachel Rader. At the center of ATI are sculptural forms made of glass, metal,
  fibers, and other materials that are made to look like mythical versions of geological
  specimens. Ancient Truth Investigators is an exploration in performance art, wearable
  objects, and concept-driven sculptural forms.
