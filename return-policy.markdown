## Replacing a lost earring

If you lose one of your Spotted Quartz earrings we will gladly make another match. The cost for this service is the half the current price of the pair of earrings plus all shipping costs. If the earring is no longer available for sale here you may need to send us the one remaining earring so that we can replicate it correctly. Email us and we'll work out the details.
