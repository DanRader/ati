As part of the Ancient Truth Investigators project, Rader invites fellow artists to participate in her world, and find their voice (or their imagined character's voice), through the parameters of the storyline. Artists enter this project for a period of time to explore, play, and create something new outside of their own artistic practice. Each member of this rotating cast of artists, brings nuances to the Ancient Truth Investigators project that didn't exist before. As participants freely enter and exit the world, they leave behind their everlasting mark on the ATI project.
