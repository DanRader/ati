Ancient Truth Investigators (ATI) is a project by Richmond, Virginia-based artist Rachel Rader (she/her). ATI explores narrative-driven performance art, wearable objects, and sculptural forms. Rachel's artwork is anchored in humor and a commitment to discovery, blurring the line between fact and fiction. ATI playfully presents artifice as a representation of our origin story and the tools required to unearth 'truths'
