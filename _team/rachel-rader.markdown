Rachel Rader is a Brooklyn based artist and storyteller. To provide an alternate context Rader has created an alter ego who is the Chief Investigator for the Ancient Truth Investigators. Through ideals associated with New Age Mysticism, she gives deeper meaning to the objects she makes. By assuming this alter ego, Rader invites the audience to suspend their disbelief and engage with my artworks with a heightened sense of receptivity to a fantastical experience. The organization is a construct but Rader’s belief in the power of positive manifestations and the magic of storytelling is very real.
