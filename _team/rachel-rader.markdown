Ancient Truth Investigators (ATI), is a project of Richmond, Virginia-based artist, Rachel Rader (she/her). ATI is a narrative-driven exploration of performance art, wearable objects, and sculptural forms. Every organization needs a team, so she has developed characters that are her alter egos within the ATI narrative. By embodying the characters in her ATI storyline, she invites viewers to suspend their disbelief and engage in her artwork with a heightened sense of receptivity to a fantastical experience. The cornerstone of Rachel's artwork is humor and a devotion to discovery. Her work rides the line between fact and fiction. She intentionally presents the objects she creates in a performative context balancing sincerity and levity. Her work is a playful presentation of artifice: a representation of our origin story and the tools needed to excavate “truths”.
