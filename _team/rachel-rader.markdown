Ancient Truth Investigators (ATI), is a project of Richmond, Virginia-based artist, Rachel Rader (she/her). ATI is a narrative-driven exploration of performance art, wearable objects, and sculptural forms. The cornerstone of Rachel's artwork is humor and a devotion to discovery. Her work rides the line between fact and fiction. ATI is a playful presentation of artifice: a representation of our origin story and the tools needed to excavate “truths”.
