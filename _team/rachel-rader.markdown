Rachel Rader is a Richmond, Virginia-based whose work blends traditional craft materials with contemporary concepts. Her multifaceted practice is anchored in the ongoing narrative of Ancient Truth Investigators (ATI), a speculative exploration of time travel and space exploration. Through a dynamic fusion of performance art, wearable objects, and sculptural forms, Rader engages with themes of memory, humor, and the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction. Each piece invites viewers to consider the interplay of history, myth, and discovery, offering both a visual and intellectual dialogue. Raderâ€™s work challenges the conventional, pushing the limits of craft and narrative, while inviting audiences to reflect on the mysterious and the unknown.
