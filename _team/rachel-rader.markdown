Ancient Truth Investigators (ATI), is a project of Brooklyn-based artist, Rachel Rader. 

ATI is a narrative-driven exploration in performance art, wearable objects, and sculptural forms. By embodying the characters in her ATI storyline, Rachel invites viewers to suspend their disbelief and engage in her artwork with a heightened sense of receptivity to a fantastical experience.
