### Well to answer that question, we would have to begin with the explanation of the word c*hakra. *

A chakra is an energy center of which there are multiple points in and around the body. The word chakra is derived from the Sanskrit word for wheel or circle, which relates to the spiritual understanding of [dharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma). The concept of a chakra is found in the tantric traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. With the popularization of yoga in the Western world, the word chakra has become a household name. 

The concept of chakras differs depending on the cultural tradition, but for the purposes of the Ancient Truth Investigators, the Chief has been investigating the links of these meridians to the endocrine system. Chakras are not physical but are rather aspects of consciousness, similar to auras. But, chakras have an affect on the physical body via the endocrine system and nervous system.

The endocrine system includes all of the glands of the body and the hormones produced by those glands.

The alignment of the endocrine system relates to the chakras of the spiritual body.

Crown Chakra = **Pituitary Gland**

Brow Chakra = **Pineal Gland**

Throat Chakra = **Thyroid Gland**

Heart Chakra = **Thymus Gland**

Solar Plexus = **Adrenal Glands**

Sacral Chakra = **Reproductive Glands**

Root Chakra = **Adrenal Cortex Glands**

The balance of the mind, body, and spirit take a lot of work. So, the Chief started the Chakra Enhancement line in hopes of creating tools of alignment for everyday-wear. The specimens that are at the center of the Chief's designs were found at particular points around the planet which relate to the Earth's meridian centers. Each jewelry piece has the potential to amplify the wearers' positive manifestation powers. 

The team goes to great lengths to find these special elements that are ideal for chakra enhancement.

The specimens are then brought back to the lab where they are cleaned, and amplified for maximum chakra enhancement.
