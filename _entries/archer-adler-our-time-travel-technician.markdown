### The Chief recently sat down with Archer Adler to find out what she's been up to in the lab.

The Chief: Thanks for taking the time to discuss your investigations.

Archer: I have all the time in the world.

The Chief: Now that pleasantries are out of the way... Have you made progress on your time travel investigations? I've been meaning to alter a few things in the past...

Archer: Well, the trouble with changing the past is that you immediately create new realms and step outside of your own timeline. It's imperative to remain an observer as a time traveler if you wish to come back to your present experience.

The Chief: Sounds complicated.

Archer: You have no idea. I've accidentally created new timelines on a few occasions and found it very challenging to return to my preset timeline. I've been working on the technology to keep track of timelines-- a beacon back to the self.

The Chief: I could use one of those!

Archer: You're telling me.

The Chief: So, how did you do it? How did you discover the key to time travel?

Archer: The answer lies in understanding the manipulation of elementary particles. Assimilation on the cellular level to these zero-dimensional points of existence propels the mind and body to other dimensions, and opens the door to time travel.

The Chief: I don't really understand how that's possible.

Archer: Seeing is believing.

The Chief: Is that an invitation?

Archer: Sure!

The Chief: I'll pack the snacks.

Archer: Haha! Well, I need to make more advancements with the time travel device before I risk bringing travel companions. But, you're the first on the invite list.

The Chief: Aw shucks! Well, I look forward to hearing more about how things develop in the lab.

Archer: I'll keep you posted, Chief. Until next time...
