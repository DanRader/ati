The Chief recently sat down with Archer Adler, Ancient Truth Investigators' Time Travel Technician to get the scoop on what she's been up to in and out of the lab. 

The Chief: Thanks for taking the time to sit with me to discuss your investigations. 
Archer: I have all the time in the world. 
The Chief: Now that pleasantries are out of the way... Have you made progress on your time travel investigations? I've been meaning to alter a few things in the past...
Archer: Well, the trouble with changing the past is that you immediately create new realms and step outside of your own timeline. It's imperative to remain an observer as a time traveler if you wish to come back to your present experience. 
The Chief: Sounds complicated.
Archer: You have no idea. I've accidentally created new timelines on a few occasions and found it very challenging to return to my preset timeline. I've been working on the technology to keep track of timelines-- a beacon back to the self. 
The Chief: I could use one of those!
Archer: You're telling me.

The Chief: So, how did you do it? How did you discover the key to time travel?
Archer: The answer lies in understanding the manipulation of elementary particles. Assimilation on the cellular level to these zero-dimensional points of existence propels the mind and body to other dimensions, and opens the door to time.
