Last week, we had a chance to sit down with The Chief and ask her a few questions about what she's been up to lately.

\*\*Hi there Chief, thanks for taking the time out of your busy schedule to do an interview. \*\*
Oh, my pleasure.
**You were absent from the lab for a while there, what have you been up to?**
Well, most of what I've been researching is highly classified. But, what I can tell you is that there's been some pretty amazing developments that have spawned from my investigations in Mexico.\
**That sounds very exciting! Is there anything that you would be willing to share from your time there?**
