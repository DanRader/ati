I just returned from a month long residency at [Starworks in Star, North Carolina](https://www.starworksnc.org/glass) where I had the opportunity to explore new ideas. It was such an amazing experience working with the Starworks team to create new tools for Ancient Truth Investigators. I made so many new discoveries and new friends along the way. It will probably take a while to review the data collected, and to refine our findings before submitting it for peer review but Iâ€™m absolutely thrilled with what we found. For more, make sure to explore my latest posts on Instagram and Tiktok.

The image above is a little sneak peek of one of the dimension-defying optic lenses I made in the glassblowing studio at Star that will allow the team and I to traverse through the multiverse. More soon on this developing series.
