As the Northern Hemisphere tilts toward the sun, we begin to experience the natural shift in light, with the longer days illuminating our world in richer, more vibrant hues. This seasonal transition inspired me to revisit our Pixelated Collection—an ongoing exploration of color, light, and their interplay—and I’m excited to announce that new products have been added to the lineup!
If you’ve been following Ancient Truth Investigators over the years, you may have noticed a conscious narrowing of our color palette. We've intentionally focused on primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. These foundational hues are not only essential to color theory but also symbolize the origins of both light and color. When combined, they form the basis for the full spectrum of visible light, which manifests as a rainbow of colors. This fundamental concept speaks to the ancient understanding of light's role in both art and nature.

The phenomena of light refracting through a prism provides a perfect example of how these primary colors blend and refract into the vibrant array we see in the world around us. It’s this natural occurrence that inspired the Pixelated Collection: a series of homeware pieces that capture the magic of light’s spectrum in vibrant fused glass forms.

Explore our [PIXELATED COLLECTION](https://the-ancient-truth-investigators-shop.myshopify.com/collections/pixelated-dishes) and let the interplay of color and light brighten your space!
