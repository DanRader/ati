We're getting ready for some upcoming exhibitions and markets over the next couple of months.  [See the list of sightings for more information!](https://ancienttruthinvestigators.com/sightings/)

This new series is made with latex rubber and powder-coated metal. Inspired by time travel theories and drawing visual connections to Memphis design - this is a bold new line of jewelry for a new timeline. 

We'll post a new collection to the shop soon, stay tuned.
