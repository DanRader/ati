It seems the world is opening back up, at least here in our little corner of it. And 100% that's thanks to having access to the vaccine (thanks science!). So, show's are coming back and I'm happy to report that I'm dialed into a handful of exhibitions coming up, (more soon... Check out our "Sightings" section). And one that recently opened at the Monique Rancourt Jewelry Gallery in Massachusetts called "Outside the Lines". There's a lovely online catalog of all the amazing artists involved (and damn, I'm in very good company). [Here's the LINK! ](https://www.moniquerancourt.com/outside-the-lines)

I've got 3 pieces in the show including this Loop Ring in yellow:

On view through July 31st, 2021. The show explores the use of color jewelry in both traditional and unconventional methods from different applications including powder coating, enameling, stone setting, patinas and more.
