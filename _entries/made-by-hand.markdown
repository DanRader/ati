With Labor Day Weekend upon us, it seems like the perfect moment to reflect on why I create everything by hand. If you're reading this, it's likely because you have an appreciation for handmade jewelry and objects. I’m so glad you found me!

I’m proud of the fact that in each one of my pieces you can find evidence of my making process, and the fact that each piece is a unique version of that design. I create every Galactic Good with intent and care.

ATI emerged from my passion for material exploration and my drive to connect my art to my story. The latest series from the ATI lab is inspired by my colleague Archer Adler and her journeys through time and space. Each shape, color, and design is connected to her explorations.

Lately, I’ve been focused on enhancing the Space Specimens discovered by our team, setting them in elegant 18k gold-plated settings. You can explore this new collection at [Penland Gallery](https://penland.org/gallery/) through October 20th.
