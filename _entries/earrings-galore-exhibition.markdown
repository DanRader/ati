Earrings Galore, is an annual juried exhibition, exemplifying a rich and diverse array of earrings made by emerging and established studio jewelers. Each artistâ€™s unique approach to the earring format is represented in a cohesive grouping of earrings. The exhibition is intended to create more access for the public to see art jewelry, cultivate connections with the community and provide an opportunity for visitors to add new pieces to their jewelry collections. 

We're thrilled to be a part of this travelling exhibition which debuted at the NYC Jewelry Week. It is currently on view at the Heidi Lowe Gallery in Lewes Gallery, and will then travel to Mexico City for the ZONAMACO art fair, then to the SNAG Conference in San Diego, CA. 

Here is a selection of pieces from the Asteroid Collection that is in the Earrings Galore show, made by Rachel Rader of the Ancient Truth Investigators project.
