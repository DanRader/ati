The opening of "Galactic Selfies and Iconic Discoveries of Archer Adler", was kicked off with a performance with, yours truly, the Chief. I introduced the recent discoveries and artifacts of Archer Adler, my friend and colleague.

A summary of the mechanisms and findings throughout the space was detailed in my briefing including an explanation of each Time Travel device and their functions.

For the first time, in possibly all of the span of Humanity I showcased a live specimen of Primordial Ooze. What an amazing opportunity for all involved to connect with their ancient microbial ancestors.

The event concluded with a demonstration of the most powerful element that originated life: light!
