The Chief Investigator is a part of a group exhibition opening at the [UrbanGlass Gallery](https://www.urbanglass.org/events/detail/clue-mr.-drury-with-eyes-wide-open), at 647 Fulton Street, Brooklyn, NY. The opening reception will be from 6-8pm on September 6th. If you can't make the opening, the exhibition will be installed though October 28th, 2017.

In CLUE, the Chief Investigator, Ráchel Räder, has created a work space to invite visitors to contemplate the Elements. Each specimen was found on her travels to key chakra energy points around the planet. Räder invites visitors to observe, record, and report their findings on the form included in the investigation work space. All data collected at this pivotal location will be collected by the team and quantified for future research.

The three words that have driven the organization in a forward march towards investigation of ancient truths, hold immense power: Observe, Record, Report.

ob·serve: /// əbˈzərv /// verb /// *Notice or perceive (something) and register it as being significant.*

rec·ord: /// rəˈkôrd /// verb /// *Set down in writing or some other permanent form for later reference, especially officially.*

re·port: /// rəˈpôrt /// verb /// *Give a spoken or written account of something that one has observed, heard, done, or investigated.*

The Chief explores these actions in her installation in [CLUE.](https://www.urbanglass.org/events/detail/clue-mr.-drury-with-eyes-wide-open) We hope you'll join the investigation!
