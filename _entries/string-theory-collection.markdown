What has the Ancient Truth Investigators team been up to? Too much to list here. But after her sabbatical, The Chief is ready to share some explorations that are afoot in the lab. 

A series of new designs based on Archer Adler's investigations of time travel are the latest buzz.

The team's investigations into String Theory, The Infinite Cylinder,  and Teleportation resulted in the current physical manifestation of this new line of wearable forms.
