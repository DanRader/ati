These past 3 weeks have been an amazing opportunity for the Ancient Truth Investigators to research, collaborate and share while in beautiful South Jersey! [WheatonArts   ](http://www.wheatonarts.org/)generously allowed The Chief to set up an installation of the latest findings made by the team that was open to the public, called the House of Truth.

This space will continue to be installed through the fall as a sacred space and collaborative environment for the Ancient Truth Investigators. Stay tuned for further developments including publications resulting from their research.
