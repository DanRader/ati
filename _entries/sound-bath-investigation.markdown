In her latest investigation into the healing properties of sound, The Chief participated in a sound bath at the [Maha Rose Center](https://www.maharose.com/) in Brooklyn, NY.

Sound healing operates from the principle of resonance, vibration, and a body-mind integrated approach to wellness. The practitioner at Maha Rose used a combination of tuning forks, crystal bowls, and quartz xylophone to name a few of the instruments used in a sequence of vibrations during the session. Sound frequencies can be used to promote relaxation and wellness, but has also been [scientifically linked to healing](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2044.2005.04287.x).

The session started in subdued lighting, and a room full of women scrambling to find a spot in the tiny carpeted room. Much like a yoga class, each participant found their nook on the floor and shuffled through a few movements in their spot until they settled in their place. As the practitioner took to the front of the room, she greeted the room and then took to a Tibetan song bowl. The warm swarming sound of the mallet against the rim of the bowl ebbed and flowed in its intensity. Then, she raised the glass xylphone and strummed the breadth of the instrument causing the aligned glass tubes to buzz. She swayed the the instrument back and forth to intensify the emanating sounds. She made her way through nearly all the instruments lined up in rows at her feet in the duration of nearly 2 hours. By the end, the Chief said she felt like she had transported to another dimension.
