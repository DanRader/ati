Change is coming. Do you feel it? We're quiet—but not still. The Lab hums with potential energy, like the space between stars just before a supernova. Our minds are deep in the gravitational pull of new ideas, and the mysterious physics that guides the cosmos.

It’s been hard to pull myself away from the vortex of experimentation. But I know how much these transmissions mean to you, and The Chief does not want to disappoint!

The concept of time has been stretched thin around here, almost like the spaghettification that happens near a black hole’s event horizon. As we explore ideas of distortion and collapse, you’ll begin to see them reflected in our objects—jewelry that echoes the curve of space-time.

The Wavelength Collection, a line that traces the intersection between energy and ornament, is returning this June, reimagined and recalibrated. Some of your favorite pieces will be back, along with a few fresh emissions straight from the Lab.

Mark Your Calendar: Web Drop – June 14. Expect newly engineered designs, customer favorites with a few cosmic upgrades, and a subtle overhaul of our digital station (aka: our website’s getting a glow-up).

If you're on Earth and happen to be orbiting near Brooklyn, NY, come visit our temporal outpost at [Renegade Craft, June 7 + 8.](https://ancienttruthinvestigators.com/sightings/) We’ll be exhibiting rare pieces and prototypes, some of which might not make it to the web.

Lately, I’ve been meditating on satellites—not just the artificial ones that circle our planet and beam back images and data, but the metaphorical satellites. What if a piece of jewelry could act like a satellite—transmitting intention, collecting energy, reflecting your trajectory?

That’s the ethos we’re channeling in the next chapter of our journey. Think of each object not just as a piece to wear, but as a signal to the universe—a marker of your path through space and time.
