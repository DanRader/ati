These Space Specimen Earrings are part of a special collection by Rachel Rader that are currently featured in an ongoing exhibition with Heidi Lowe Gallery, called Earrings Galore. Next stop for this traveling show is Mexico City for the ZONA MACO art fair. Made from carved glass and 18k gold-plated brass, each pair is handcrafted in the ATI lab.
