The Chief has developed a new product to aid in alignment of the 7 chakras of the body. After a long and arduous period of research in the ATI lab, the team has found a way to bring this method of synchronicity to the public. We will announce this exciting new development in the next week, but first we must stamp each piece with the ATI mark of approval.

Stay tuned.
