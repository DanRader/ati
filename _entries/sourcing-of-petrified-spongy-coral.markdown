The ATI team diving for Spongy Coral.

This renewable resource which is replanted every year by the ATI team, soaks in the healing powers of the Earth. Once brought out of its watery environment, it automatically petrifies into the Petrified Spongy Coral, which ATI can mill into a wearable form.

The Chief is fabricating a new collection of Petrified Spongy Coral rings for both the Museum of Contemporary Craft in Portland, OR and UrbanGlass|ware,  Brooklyn, NY.

Can't make it to these locations? The Chief will have a collection of Chakra Enhancers posted online in time for the holidays.

Stay tuned.
