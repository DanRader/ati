Have you explored the Shop section of our website lately? There's a ton of new pieces from the String Theory Collection, aligned with Archer Adler's travels through time and space.

These flexible forms (much like time and space), move with the wearer and symbolize the countless forms of time travel and time loops.

Where can you see this collection in person? So far, The Chief has lined up 2 shows:


[Renegade Craft in San Francisco](https://www.renegadecraft.com/city/san-francisco), April 4-5.

And we will be part of a group show at [Gallery 2052 in Chicago](https://www.facebook.com/events/142140277082479/), that opens March 18 called "Mad For Hoops".
