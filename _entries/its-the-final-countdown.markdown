Thank you to everyone who has helped us get closer to our goal. We are just a few days away from the end of our fundraiser: [Stepping Into the Vortex](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/stepping-into-the-vortex). So, if you have been thinking of participating, this is the time.

By contributing in these final days, you would make a huge difference.

As a thank you for your contribution Jason Blandford and [Rachel Rader](http://www.rachelrader.com/about/) have listed handmade gifts like the **Petrified Spongy Coral Charm Bracelet** ($40) and **Necklace** ($60) below! **Click on the button above** to see your options!

And thank you for considering a contribution to help make this project come to life.
