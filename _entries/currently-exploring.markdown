The Chief is currently exploring manifestations of energy and electricity. A few prototypes have begun to evolve in the ATI Laboratory in Brooklyn, NY, after a class she took at [UrbanGlass](https://urbanglass.org/).
The glass tubes can be bent in a high-temperature flame, and then bombarded with chemical elements. This is a phosphorous coated glass tube filled with Argon Mercury.

And this is a clear tube filled with Argon.

In combination with the powerful energies sourced in the specimens found by ATI, the Chief is exploring neon's visual potential in calculation of particular emanations.
Much like the Alchemists, the Chief views nature's energetic potential intriguing.

Painting by Joseph Wright of an alchemist discovering fluorescence from wood of the narra tree in the 1560's. Fluorescence accidentally isolated in 1602 by an alchemist who was experimentally baking substances in the search for gold, which, in this case, glowed in the dark, even after cooling.
The goal of the alchemists, who practiced from 400-1400 AD, was to transmute common elements (like lead) into gold. Because there were seven known heavenly bodies, the alchemists believed that there were seven base elements. The alchemists used symbols to identify elements, and made many important discoveries which led to the development of the modern science of chemistry.

When science was called Alchemy and Magic...

As the Chief develops her explorations, we'll post more process shots to the log book. Stay tuned.
