The Ancient Truth Investigators have proven that the bands of the Banded Strattite can be directional in their energetic potential. Just as ley lines stretch across the planet uniting the chakra points of the world, so do the stripes of Banded Strattite when on or near the body.

Use this powerful element wisely. It is associated with the center of wisdom and power: The Sacral Chakra.
