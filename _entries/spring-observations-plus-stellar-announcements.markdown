As spring unfurls across our hemisphere, the axial tilt of our planet (23.5°, to be precise) blesses us with longer days, blooming flora, and renewed creative energy in the Lab. The increase in solar radiation triggers not only the blossoming of terrestrial botanicals, but also the activation of our imaginations—fueling the next wave of Galactic Goods, currently in the prototype phase. Stay tuned… we’re testing some truly time-bending designs.

Want to experience our wares in the tangible realm? I’ll be appearing at several markets this season to share our handcrafted jewelry and cosmic wares in person. Come say hello, handle the Goods, and swap stories of science and stardust. See our list of sightings [HERE!](https://ancienttruthinvestigators.com/sightings/)

Back in the Lab, we’re cooking up new collections with mysterious materials and alternate timelines in mind. Our subscribers will be the first to know when new pieces drop—consider this your early briefing.

Until next time, stay curious, stay kind, and always question gravity.
